    <title>Blog 2 - Experience with money</title>

    <h1>My Experience with money</h1>
    <p>I am an adolescent writing this at precisely 2:00 am why because I am bored and I have nothing to eat and I can’t sleep. 
        I have been planning on writing this because I have seen the dark side of money and believe me its very dark, I have seen people killing themselves for money yeah you read it right literally killing themselves, human relationships spanning over like 20 years getting destroyed for cups of money lol. I will narrate the story of how high net worth individuals are very predatory, I have a decent experience with high net worth individuals and to be honest they are the most scary people one could ever meet, always looking for opportunities to make more money, always looking for opportunities to legally snatch something, there was this person for my who interviewed for my podcast and later on he called me up and offered me partnership to make a podcast with him and when I asked him why do you intend to host a podcast with me he said nothing much just looking to make some more money by monetizing it and its the trend, these high net worth individuals often hop with the trend and help to continue the trend and there was this guy asked me for a partnership in my tea brand, when I asked him why do you want to partner with me he said to make more money, I have been trying to do new things to know my excellence zone and I don’t have any intent to make money from it though I wanted it to help me be you know be financially independent and the final nail in the coffin I met this guy who was readily interested in investing in my company for around 20% stake he said that he will fund me till series A ( basically helping me reach 250 crore valuation ), I asked why till series A he had no reply our visions didn’t match and he was always looking for chances to monetize things and make money out of it, these people are very predatory often they will set their mentorship as the bait to use you, your time and your peace which is very important, beware of them and always watch out. 
        
        Many of them who are of my age are focusing  more on materialistic things in the life but you need to realize that those materialistic things are just a medium of getting you to the peace you want in life and there are various ways you can be peaceful in your life, for me I have tried 6-8 different paths to make money ( programming, trading, podcasting, business, freelancing, teaching etc) and if doesn’t make me happy doing it I don’t continue to do it though some skills are needed to make your life easy and save time and I suggest learning those skills no matter how difficult they are. 
        Ask yourself what drives the intent behind the things you want. Often people focus on the end goal its their motivation to reach something this is overconfidence bias because of their extreme focus on the end goal they forget to look into the steps which will take them there and underestimate those steps and the time it will take, this is common among governments building something which didn’t you know finish with time or maybe government overspending on olympics budget plethora of examples. The point I am trying to make is if your end motivation is making money please look carefully into what will it take to make money and don’t underestimate it because there are billions like you trying to make money by focusing on the end goal and they end up achieving it but at the cost of making their journey miserable hence making their life miserable. From having a happy life and zero money we end up having a miserable life and tons of money and I don’t think the trade off is worth it.    
        I am just sharing my experience with you all, I am lazy guy and moody guy who is very impulsive and its my impulsive nature which helps me explore my world. 
        This experience will change as i meet new people and god i need change of experiences.
