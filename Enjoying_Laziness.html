    <h3>Enjoying Laziness</h3>
    <p>I do not know why I am writing this today maybe because I had this weird day and I wanted to tell my audience about it and maybe gaze some attention from them, weird day in sense I was asked by my Ophthalmologists ( another fancy medical term for eye doctors ) to rest the whole day. 
        Today my laziness was at its peak and I slept more than maybe 13 hours, I am lazy I know it but when I ask myself why am I lazy or let me phrase it better why do I enjoy being lazy? After thinking for a while and reconciling facts from various places ( Writing this to make my audience believe that I know something üòÜ ) i realized that we humans were not made to you know work the whole day during our hunting and gathering days we used to hunt for few hours ( enough to eat the whole day ) and spend rest of our time maybe doing things which made us feel good like spending time with the family ( clan members to be precise ) and this psychology is ingrained in our genetics ( even now ) but now people work for more than 10 hours/day. Today the world is very different from the world we lived in like maybe 20000 years, the present century is very demanding we have billions of people fighting for single piece of bread, this might be easy to read because somethings are only known better when we experience it. Still these facts might partially answer that why do we enjoy being lazy but I can‚Äôt find a concrete answer in the explanation maybe the answer is in the statement ‚ÄúWhy do we enjoy being lazy‚Äù this word didn‚Äôt catch my attention when I was planning to write this blog but you guys might have noticed it. We enjoy being lazy because we ‚ÄúENJOY‚Äù being lazy. Laziness doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean to sit idle it means doing something where we don‚Äôt want to spend our energy and to enjoy something doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we need to spend energy in it and this might be the reason we might enjoy being lazy because its fun and helps to focus more on the things we like doing. 
        No one is made to work like 10+ hours a day we want to enjoy life and we can only be productive for 10+ hours a day when we enjoy our work not everyone is made for the same corporate life, some even want to live a van life with just enough resources to get them through the life ( Not me but I know some people ), so to enjoy life you will have to enjoy the things you do, for me I enjoy sleeping so I slept like a sloth the whole day though I shouldn‚Äôt because its one of the 7 sins but I had nothing better to do today maybe I had better things to do but I didn‚Äôt want to because sleeping is fun and easy, other tasks might be fun like scrolling instagram, texting people ( though I only send them memes ) but sleeping still wins ( because its the only thing which didn‚Äôt require use of my eyes ). 
        EOD We should be lazy because laziness allows us to explore ourselves find different avenues which can help us find the things we enjoy in life thus leading to a more fulfilling life. Please note I am just an adolescent who seeks refuge in his blogs whenever he is low maybe because of his own expectations of himself so I will be inconsistent with my blogs and only be back when I am low on life to get some hit, because this low period is the only time when I have time to express myself or find other people worth investing my time in, till then be lazy explore your world and find things you enjoy doing.
