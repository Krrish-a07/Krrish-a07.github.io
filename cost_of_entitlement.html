    <h1>Price of entitlement</h1>
    <p>It feels good to be entitled right? Having a title that acknowledges that you have done something in your life and made something good out of it for the moment, but have you ever wondered what might be the cost of the title you are carrying? The cost might be your self-growth, and the cost might be your life. 
    When we hold a title with pride, we get a sense of achievement and donâ€™t strive to become a better version of ourselves. This will eventually lead us to be stuck in the same place while taking the pace of our self-growth to almost 0, and the people around us will eventually grow at a much higher pace than we are growing.
    This will also affect your life psychologically will make you feel frustrated and question your life and your actions multiple time
    We should be aware that every title comes with a price, please question yourself that before holding that title are you ready to pay the price of the title and while holding the title will it consume you in pride?
