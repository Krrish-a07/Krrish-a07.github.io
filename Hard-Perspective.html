    Why am I writing this? Again because I am super bored and I have no one to talk to or rather I would say I don’t want to talk with anyone right now
    When we see two friends fighting over pity things we are like one can easily compromise to end the fight right? and then we ask one of our friends to do a compro which again enrages him further and Maybe the situation gets more complicated, so I would ask what went wrong here? Nothing just we didn’t see the things from his perspective, how did he perceive the situation, did he believe that the fault was his or maybe their was misunderstanding and both the parties where right with their stance. It’s very important to be in the shoes of others to understand them better because you never know what lies behind the mask. 
    Bye Ciao! I don’t have more things to write.
